Files for paper on Neural synchrony for adaptive control

Model.m file contains Matlab code to simulate the model. 
All three models can be simulated by changing parameter values.
Current parameter settings simulate the spatiotemporal adaptive model
Also the supplementary simulations of control on different timescales can be performed with slight adaptations to this script

Pre_analyses.m combines relevant data of several simulations into one datafile that can be analyzed in R

Analyses.R analyzes the data of all three models described in the paper and makes plots

Parameter explorations are performed with files
Control_par_explore.m and Accumulator_par_explore.m

and analyzed by files
analyses_accumulator_explore.R and Analyses_control_explore.R

the Analyses_timescales.R file provides a script to analyze data from supplementary simulations on different timescales for control.
