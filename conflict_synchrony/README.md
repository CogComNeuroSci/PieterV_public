# Neural synchrony for adaptive control

## Simulations.m file 
Matlab code to simulate the model versions. 
  - The model to simulate is defined in the file. 

## Pre_analyses.m 
combines relevant data of several simulations into one datafile that can be analyzed in R

## Analyses.R 
analyzes the data of all three models described in the paper and makes plots

## Parameter explorations (supplementary materials)
Simulation: Control_par_explore.m and Accumulator_par_explore.m
Analyzing: analyses_accumulator_explore.R and Analyses_control_explore.R
