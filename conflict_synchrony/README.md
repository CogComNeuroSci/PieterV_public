# Neural synchrony for adaptive control

## Simulations.m file 
Matlab code to simulate the model versions. 
  - The model to simulate is defined in the file. 

## Pre_analyses.m 
combines relevant data of several simulations into one datafile that can be analyzed in R

## Analyses.R 
analyzes the data of all three models described in the paper and makes plots

## Empirical_gratton_analyses.R
Re-analyses the open data set of Schmidt & Weissman 2014 (https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0102337)

## Parameter explorations (supplementary materials)
Simulation: Control_par_explore.m; Accumulator_par_explore.m and Frequency_par_explore.m
Analyzing: analyses_control_explore.R; Analyses_accumulator_explore.R and Analyses_frequency_explore.R
