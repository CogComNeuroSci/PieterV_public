# Learning to synchronize: How biological agents can couple neural task modules for dealing with the stability-plasticity dilemma.

I recently did an extra effort to provide decent comments. 
Importantly, I only did this for the PlosCompBio (the published) part.

**For Python coders:** In the first version of the preprint I also included Python code.
This was meant as an exercise for myself, it was the first thing I ever did in Python.
So, to be honest these scripts are complete shit.
To compensate I made a (slightly) better and well commented script for a very simplistic version of the Sync model.
Symplistic_model.py just demonstrates a simple oscillatory model in which 2 stimulus-response pair is synchronized and others are desynchronized.
In my opinion it provides an excellent start to get a hang of the basic model mechanisms.

*Enjoy!*
