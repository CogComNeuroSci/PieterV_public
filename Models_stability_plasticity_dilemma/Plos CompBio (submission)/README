This folder contains scripts used for model simulation and analyses

we have analyses files
sync files containing the model code with synchrony
synaptic files containing the model code without synchrony
Additionally, the 
RW_RL and RW_frequency are scripts used for the parameter explorations 
for respectively the RL unit and the oscillatory nodes

other RW scripts hold the simulation and analyses scripts

for backpropagation we have seperate scripts for the 2 and 3 dimensional tasks

for RBM we only simulated a 3 dimensional task
