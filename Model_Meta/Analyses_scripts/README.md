# Analyses scripts

**Before analyzing the data, one should have fitted and simulated the models with scripts from the Model_scripts folder**

Scripts are made in R-studio

---

## Fitting_analyses.R

Extracts all data from the model fitting procedures and computes weighted model fit measures

___

## Simulation_analyses_and_ploting.R

Extracts all data from model simulations

Additionally, it performs the linear mixed model regressions. 

And it provides code to make all plots that are provided in the paper.

___

## LearningCurves.R

Provides code to make some descriptive (mean accuracy) plots for the empirical datasets as well as model fit. Most of these figures are shown in the supplementary materials but some data is also shown in Figure 2 of the manuscript

___

## Recovery_analyses.R

Provides code to analyse and make plots for the parameter and model recovery analyses as described in the supplementary materials.
