# Analyses scripts

**Before analyzing the data, one should have fitted and simulated the models with scripts from the Model_scripts folder**

Scripts are made in R-studio

---
## Descriptive analyses.R

Provides code to make some descriptive (mean accuracy) plots for all empirical datasets
___

## Fitting_analyses.R

Extracts all data from the model fitting procedures and computes weighted model fit measures

___

## Simulation_analyses_and_ploting.R

Extracts all data from model simulations

Additionally, it performs the linear mixed model regressions. 

And it provides code to make all plots that are provided in the paper.
___

## Recovery_analyses.R

Provides code to analyse and make plots for the parameter and model recovery analyses as described in the supplementary materials.
