___
*1. Behavioral folder:* Folder with all python files to fit the different models to the behavioral data
  
*2. EEG folder:* Different folders with a combination of Matlab and R files to analyze all EEG data
    - Preprocessing
    - Standard time-frequency analyses with extraction of power and phase data
    - PLV for phase locking analyses
    - Cluster analyses to extract significant clusters in power and plv and correlate them with wAIC values of behavioral model fit
    - Trial-window-analyses to check how power in clusters changes with respect to rule switch
  
*3. Model simulations:* Matlab scripts to simulate the Sync model
  
*4. Psychopy scripts:* Scripts for doing the experiment
